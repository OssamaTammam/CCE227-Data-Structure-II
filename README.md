## Sorting Algorithms

This project focuses on sorting techniques in computer science, aiming to optimize and explore different sorting algorithms. It covers Quick Sort, a Divide and Conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element for partitioning. It also includes Merge Sort, which divides the input array into two halves and merges them after sorting. The project requires implementing both algorithms and analyzing their running times. Additionally, the project involves implementing O(n^2) sorting algorithms, generating random arrays, and plotting a graph to compare the performance of different sorting algorithms.

## Red Black Trees

This project focuses on Red-Black Trees, a type of balanced binary search tree. Red-Black Trees ensure that the height of the tree remains O(log n), guaranteeing efficient operations such as search, insertion, and printing the size and height of the tree. The lab assignment's goal is to implement the Red-Black Tree data structure, supporting operations like search, insertion, and printing the tree's size and height.

An application of the Red-Black Tree implementation is an English dictionary. The project requires implementing a text-based user interface for the dictionary, allowing functionalities such as loading the dictionary from a file, printing the size of the dictionary, inserting new words, and looking up words.

## Graphs

This project focuses on implementing and analyzing two fundamental graph algorithms: Prim's algorithm and Dijkstra's algorithm. Prim's algorithm finds the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected weighted graph, while Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path between a source vertex and all other vertices. The project aims to explore the efficiency, correctness, and practical applications of both algorithms through implementation and analysis on various graph structures.
